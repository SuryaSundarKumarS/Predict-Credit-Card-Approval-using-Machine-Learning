# Predict-Credit-Card-Approval-using-Machine-Learning
Utilized machine learning approaches to predict credit card approval based on customer information.
Conducted extensive data cleaning and preprocessing using Python's Pandas library to prepare the data for modeling.
Explored the dataset and visualized the distributions of various features using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
Built and compared multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost classifiers, using Python's Scikit-Learn library.
Achieved an accuracy of over 85% with the best performing models (Random Forest and XGBoost Classifier).
